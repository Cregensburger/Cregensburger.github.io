			<h3 id="aboutMeHeader" class="aboutContent">About</h3>
			<p id="aboutMeParagraph" class="aboutContent">Over the past three months, I have attended the programming bootcamp, General Assembly. In that time, I have learned a full-stack set of skills and utilized them on various projects. My first project, Tic Tac Toe, represents is a key point in my development as a programming. It was here that I began to learn effective planning, including wireframes and pseudo-coding, and how to implement unknown tools. </p>

			<p>Another project, App-Etite, expanded upon that foundation. I had to learn how to code and plan with other people. This was a Rails application that allowed people sign up and then post where they wanted to go to lunch and vote on entries. We implemented a number of new technologies, such as: Rails, Bootstrap and Decrypt. I have a strong interest in games and front-end design. As such, I have been trying to sharpen my skills by teaching myself how to use Unity, supplementing in-class lessons with courses on Code Academy and working on a number of side projects.</p>

			<h3>General Assembly Projects</h3>
			<p> General Assembly is an educational institute that offers full-time immersive programs, including such courses as: web development, user experience design, and digital marketing. I attended the Web Development Immersive, a three month long bootcamp dedicated to teaching non-programmers a general full-stack set of skills.</p>

			<p> While attending WDI, I have learned about a number of tools, including: programming fundamentals, product development, front-end web development and back-end web development. </p>

			<p> Below are just a few examples of the work I have done while attending GA. </p>

					<p class="projectBlurb"> My first project made for General Assembly. Given four days, we were to create a fully functional tic tac toe app. As it was a solo project, I wrote all of the code. In this project, I implemented Skeleton as a styling tool, which was something I had never used before. </p>
